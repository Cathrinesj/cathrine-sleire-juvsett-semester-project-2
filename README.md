# SeVi - Second Hand Vintage Shop

My second year Semester Project

Site is also live at: https://sevi-semesterproject.netlify.app/

### Task and requirements

Build an e-commerce website, theme is up for choice. Favourite tool of choosing for design. Logo can be found or made, but not to be spent to much time on. Good user experience, and UI design, following todays trends and design patterns.

Build a front end with home, product list, product detail and cart pages. Checkout and payment not part of project. Admin pages to create, update and delete. Strapi API to be provided, or set up self.


## Set up and run locally

You can install by cloning this repo
Use Go Live extension in VS code to run locally

Testing Admin access:

User: admin@admin.com

Password: Admin2022

## How to use the app

Home displays a set of featured products, that links directly to product details. Shop displays al products, and you are able to search for items that match your search. Cart will hold all products added to cart, with total amount. You can remove items from cart. Login gives access to admin. In Admin, you can add new products, or delete a product.

## My work

I decided to make a second hand vintage shop with my Strapi API. End product is made with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, bootstrap and SASS. A great learning experince building this one.

Known issues:

I do not currently have a subscrption with Strapi API, and therefore this site does not have any products, and it is not possible to log in. 


## Features to come

Already planned and designed:

Find or set up a new API so that the site will work as intended
